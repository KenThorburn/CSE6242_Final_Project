[Operator instructions.] Alicia Rodriguez, you may begin your conference. \nAlicia Rodriguez: Thank you, operator, and thank you and welcome everyone to Agilentâ€™s first quarter conference call for fiscal year 2014. With me are Bill Sullivan, Agilentâ€™s President and CEO; Ron Nersesian, CEO of Keysight Technologies; and Didier Hirsch, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO.  Joining in the Q&A after Didier's comments will be the presidents of our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics groups, Mike McMullen and Fred Strohmeier. Also joining from Keysight will be Neil Dougherty, CFO; and Guy SÃ©nÃ©, Senior Vice President of R&D and Sales. You can find the press release and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. While there, please click on the link for Financial Results under the Financial Information tab. There you will find an investor presentation along with revenue breakouts, business segment results, and historical financials for Agilent's operations. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Todayâ€™s comments by Bill, Ron, and Didier will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website.  We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Before turning the call over to Bill, Iâ€™d like to remind you that will host its annual analysts meeting in New York City on March 6. Details about the meeting and webcast will be available on the Agilent investor website two weeks prior to that date. And now Iâ€™d like to turn the call over to Bill.  \nBill Sullivan: Thanks, Alicia, and hello, everyone. Today Agilent reported first quarter orders of $1.68 billion, down 2% from last year and flat on a core basis. Q1 revenues of $1.68 billion were unchanged from a year ago, up 1% on a core basis. While revenues came in at the low end of guidance, adjusted earnings of $0.67 per share were at the high end of the guidance, up 8% from a year ago. Operating margin was 17.6%.  We saw a mixed business environment with continued steady growth in life science and applied markets. This was offset by continued weakness in our electronic measurement markets, particularly in aerospace and defense. Despite some ongoing economic headwinds, we continue to benefit from our commitment to manage expenses and reduce manufacturing costs.  We also continue to make excellent progress in preparing for the split of the company. On January 7, we announced Keysight Technologies as the name of the new EM company. We expect the separation to be completed by early November. As I indicated last quarter, Agilent will increasingly differentiate our electronic measurement and LDA businesses in preparation for the companyâ€™s separation. Today, I will share performance highlights for the life science diagnostics and applied markets. These businesses will be the focus of the new Agilent, as the company continues under my leadership.  Following my remarks, Ron Nersesian will discuss our electronic measurement performance, which will be the focus of the new spinoff company under his leadership. Finally, Didier Hirsch will provide a more detailed discussion of Agilentâ€™s overall financial results as well as our guidance for fiscal second quarter and the full year. Turning to LDA, our first quarter performance continued to show solid revenue growth across instruments, services, and consumables. Q1 revenues of $1 billion increased 5% year over year, reflecting strength across most end markets and a healthy Q4 backlog. Q1 orders of $979 million increased 2% over last year. The slowing in the order growth is driven by weaker demand in academic and government markets. Operating margins were up 210 basis points to 19.2%, consistent with our margin expansion goals for the businesses. We continue to f\n"

LDA requires DTM-TF, while NMF works best with DTM-TF-IDF. (BERTopic requires neither.) For both DTMs, we are case-insensitive (convert all text to lowercase), consider unigrams (single words) and bigrams (expressions consisting of two words), remove stopwords (i.e., common words that typically do not influence meaning), exclude words that appear in more than 50% of documents, and restrict the vocabulary to the 1,000 most frequent words.
