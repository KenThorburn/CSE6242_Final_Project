At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2025 Agilent Technologies Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin the conference.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, Regina, and welcome everyone to Agilent\u2019s conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Simon May, President of the Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group; Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group; and Mike Zhang, President of the Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The press release for our first quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today\u2019s discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today\u2019s comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You\u2019ll find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we implemented certain changes to our reporting structure related to reorganization of our three business segments. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes and have provided the financial details on our website. These changes have no impact on our company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company\u2019s recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thank you, Parmeet, and thanks to all of you for joining today\u2019s call. As you saw in our press release, we had a very solid start to the year, exceeding our expectations for core revenue growth and EPS. Before diving into the details, I want to first follow-up on conversations I had with many of you starting at our Analyst and Investor Day in December at the New York Stock Exchange and provide an update on progress of our Ignite Transformation. We\u2019ve stated that Ignite is for our customers, employees, and shareholders. For customers, we want to create a seamless experience across Agilent products, software, and services. For our employees, we want to become nimbler and reduce complexity to enhance our ability to serve our customers. And for shareholders, we want to deliver industry-leading shareholder value through differentiated growth. We have set targets to grow core revenues between 5% and 7% annually, expand our operating margin by 50 to 100 plus basis points per year, and deliver double-digit EPS growth. Right now, I want to share three notable accomplishments from the Ignite Transformation that focus on setting a new pricing mechanisms, elevating our digital ecosystem, and identifying procurement opportunities. First, the creation of an Enterprise strategic-pricing organization that will focus on setting our standard approach for pricing across the entire solution set with the customer and not just at a tactical bottoms-up product level. Second, our digital ecosystem, a critical enabler in our evolved strategy we unveiled at Investor Day continues to be a key area of investment for us. Already, we have made meaningful improvements to our website, upgrading the user experience on our e-commerce platform by making it easier to find and purchase the products our customers need, helping driving topline growth. In Q1, our progress continued with digital orders growing high-single-digits. And third, our procurement teams have challenged our historical approach and are identifying significant cost-savings opportunities in many of Agilent\u2019s functions. Also related to our Ignite Transformation, we\u2019re assessing our organizational health. On my first day as CEO, I promised our employees we would become a nimbler organization to make decisions faster and accelerate innovation in service of our customers. As a result, we are removing some management layers and increasing spans of control. This is a continuation of our new organizational structure we announced in late November. Through that reorganization, we\u2019re seeing our business leaders in lockstep on our strategy and transformation. This alignment enables us to make business decisions faster on priorities and trade-offs. As my leadership team and I look forward, we are focused on growing Agilent. A foundational element of growth is innovation, innovation that our customers want. Every time I visit a customer in any part of the world, they say the same thing; they want to partner with Agilent for better outcomes. That\u2019s what differentiates Agilent, the deep scientific knowledge of our customer-facing team members that our competitors simply can\u2019t duplicate. Customers want everything from the ability to parse massive amounts of data in seconds, to automating more tasks so they can focus on complex scientific challenges. In essence, they want to increase their productivity. That\u2019s why driving lab productivity is among our key priorities. You can see evidence of this in our collaborative agreement with Zurich-based ABB Robotics to produce automated laboratory solutions, ones that will help our customers find new ways of improved workflows and make operations more efficient and flexible. These are customers across multiple markets, including pharma, biotech, energy, and food. Together with ABB, Agilent can transform the customer lab operations by making workflow processes for research, development, and quality control faster and more efficient. The goal is for all instruments, robots, and software to be interoperable, which is crucial to significantly boosting productivity for our customers. Our customers want to buy whole product solutions not just a single instrument. To illustrate that, our Infinity III series that we introduced in October has seen great adoption from all our customers. As a reminder, the Infinity III has an advanced automation that simplifies our customers\u2019 daily routines and is compatible with previous generations, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And that has become a differentiator. Customers are saying that the backward compatibility combined with the modularity of Agilent systems allows them to decide how to upgrade and refresh their instruments. Plus, they\u2019re telling us that they\u2019re choosing Agilent because of our longstanding quality and technology leadership that\u2019s been further enforced with the Infinity III. And the Agilent InfinityLab LC Solutions are certified by My Green Lab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. We continue to see strong momentum and growth in our sales funnel for the Infinity III because of its advanced automation that empowers our customers to be more productive and because of InfinityLab Assist, our automation software that provides on-board intelligence. So, our customers are not simply buying a platform, but a whole product solution. Just as exciting is that the great success of our Infinity III provides Agilent an incredible opportunity for us to upgrade our customers\u2019 instruments. And it\u2019s already happening across our legacy LC platforms, representing an opportunity in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming years. Now, I\u2019d like to highlight some key aspects of our Q1 results. As you can see from our press release, we drove topline year-over-year growth while macro market trends, such as CapEx spending, continue to improve. Our revenue of $1.681 billion increased 1% over the same quarter in FY \u201824. This result exceeded our expectations and was led by excellent growth in PFAS and capturing an outsized share of the China stimulus awards. Our instrument book-to-bill was greater than one in Q1, a quarter when it\u2019s typically less than one. This is another sign of market recovery, but more importantly, it\u2019s a testament to our intense customer focus with products such as the highly successful Infinity III and our success driving our market-leading position in China. Additionally, we exceeded expectations in all regions and end markets except for Academia and Government. In our end markets, revenue was led by Food, which grew 9% driven by our success in capturing stimulus orders in China. In China, our accelerating share gains were apparent in recording a win rate of more than 50% on stimulus-related tenders. With our long history in the region elevated by our local manufacturing capabilities, we are well-positioned to expand our market leadership in China. Now, let me talk about our businesses and some growth vectors in each. Our Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group grew 1% in the quarter, reporting $647 million. Performance was driven by a nice result in our LC and LCMS instruments, which grew high-single-digits during the quarter on the heels of our Infinity III launch. Within LDG, we remain focused on the integration of BIOVECTRA and we are delighted by the response we\u2019re hearing from our existing and potential customers who are interested in leveraging BIOVECTRA\u2019s unique capabilities and Agilent\u2019s expertise. It\u2019s clear that BIOVECTRA\u2019s capabilities are in the sweet spot of tremendous markets with a terrific growth potential. The Agilent CrossLab Group grew 3%, reporting $696 million, which was in-line with our expectations, led by services. We are especially excited about the new ACG that now includes services, automation, consumables, and software and informatics. Software and informatics are among our key priorities, and we\u2019ve had an overwhelmingly positive response to both our InfinityLab Assist automation software and our OpenLab CDS. The InfinityLab automation software offers remote notifications, trouble shootings, diagnostics, and maintenance that paves the way for a fully-automated, digital lab. And our OpenLab CDS provides time-saving steps in analysis, interpretation, and reporting workflows while technical controls ensure work quality, effective records management, and enhanced data security. In short, software is an incredible area of opportunity for us that we are poised to capitalize upon. Already, customers are telling us that InfinityLab Assist and OpenLab offer differentiated functionality and solutions in high-throughput environments. Our Applied Markets Group reported $338 million in the quarter, a 2% decline better than expected related to a strong China stimulus orders. We are very pleased with our team\u2019s ability to compete and win these tenders. We continue to invest in the Applied Markets for next-generation technology innovation and, as I said, support our customers with lab productivity. Every customer we meet has expressed a desire to partner with Agilent to make better use of their instrument fleets to integrate with front-end solutions. And, we\u2019re happy to help them find ways to create customized solutions so they can deliver products faster. Before I hand over to Bob, I want to address topics that have been in the news of late. Regarding the recent news around tariffs, we have a diversified supply chain with a manufacturing presence in all major regions of the world. Our teams already are taking action to mitigate the impacts on our business. In terms of potential reductions to NIH funding, as we\u2019ve shared with you before, our exposure to NIH-related programs is limited to around 1% of our revenue. We currently believe the forecasted impact is manageable within our current guidance. Bob, will now delve deeper on our Q1 results, as well as our outlook for Q2. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Bob?\nRobert W. McMahon: Thanks Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then cover our updated full-year and second quarter guidance. As Padraig mentioned, Q1 revenue was $1.68 billion, just above the top-end of guidance despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter. On a core basis, we posted growth of 1.2%, beating expectations. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year impacts, core growth is estimated to be just over 3%. On a reported basis, growth was 1.4%. Currency had a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points, which was over one percentage point higher than estimated at the start of the quarter. And M&A contributed 1.6%. Padraig already discussed our business group results, so I\u2019ll focus on deeper details about our end markets. We exceeded expectations in all of our end markets except for our smallest one, Academia and Government. Our business in the Food market grew 9%, benefiting from our excellent performance in China\u2019s national stimulus program. In Environmental and Forensics, we grew 6% as we continue to leverage our best-in-class PFAS workflow solutions to grow our market-leading position. We continue to capitalize on the strong demand for PFAS testing that we are seeing globally. Our 6495 triple quad LCMS is the most complete instrument in the PFAS testing market with a specific performance edge in small and fragile molecules where many of the emerging PFAS exist. Along with our new offerings in PFAS-specific consumables and our workflow deployment services, Agilent provides the fastest, highest-quality and most reliable way for customers to add or expand PFAS testing capabilities in their labs. Now looking across all end markets, PFAS grew 70% in the quarter, contributing 75 basis points of growth to the company. Pharma was flat during the quarter, with low-single-digit growth ex-China offset by a high-single-digit decline in China. Globally biopharma and small molecule performed roughly in-line with the overall market. In Chemical and Advanced Materials, revenue declined 2% with growth ex-China offset by a high-teens decline in China, which was mostly impacted by the timing of the Lunar New Year. Our business in the Diagnostics and Clinical end market grew 7%, led by strong results in the Americas and Europe. Academia and Government, our smallest market, saw a decline of 7%, with soft results around the globe. Now moving on to our regional performance, the Americas grew 3%, Europe grew 2%, and Asia ex-China grew 2%, all slightly ahead of expectations. China revenue declined 4%, also better than expectations, on the strength of our stimulus performance. For your models, we estimate that Lunar New Year was a $10 million revenue headwind in the quarter, which we expect to come back in the second quarter. This compares to a $25 million favorable Lunar New Year impact in the first quarter of last year, so combined a 2 percentage point year-on-year impact. Now, let\u2019s move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 54.7% in the quarter, down versus last year primarily due to mix, currency and the Lunar New Year timing. We drove operating margins of 25.1%, roughly in-line with our expectations, despite currency headwinds. While down versus last year, we expect improvement throughout the year as the results of our Ignite Transformation continue to deliver. And below the line, our net interest expense was better than expected as was our tax rate of 12.5%. And we had $287 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.31. That was ahead of our expectations and up 2% from a year ago, growing slightly faster than revenue. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $431 million in the quarter, and we invested $97 million in capital expenditures. We purchased $90 million in shares and paid out $71 million through dividends during the quarter. And, we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.0. In summary, we had a good start to the year, and expect continued steady improvement in the market through the year. Now, let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the fiscal year and the second quarter. While we exceeded core growth expectations for Q1, we are maintaining our core growth guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% for the year. This guidance incorporates an element of prudence reflecting the uncertainty over the U.S. federal funding environment, even though it is a small part of our business. However, we are adjusting our full-year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.68 billion to $6.76 billion to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. If you recall our initial guidance back in November incorporated only a very modest FX headwind. Since then, the U.S. dollar has appreciated and based on current exchange rates, we are now projecting an incremental $110 million in currency headwinds relative to our prior guidance. Currency is now expected to represent a 1.9% headwind for the year versus a prior 20 basis point headwind. We also have left our M&A guidance unchanged at plus 2.0% to 2.2% revenue impact for the year. Full-year, non-GAAP earnings per share are unchanged at $5.54 to $5.61, representing an increase of 4.7% to 6.0%. Relative to our prior guide, currency net of hedging is an estimated additional $0.09 headwind for the year, which we are covering. This assumes flat other income and expense, a 12.5% tax rate, and $286 million diluted shares outstanding. Now for the second quarter, we are guiding to revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion. This range is a bit wider than we typically use for the upcoming quarter, reflecting the uncertainty around U.S. Federal Government spending. This range represents an increase of 2.5% to 5% growth on a core basis and an increase of 2.4% to 4.9% growth on a reported basis. Currency is a 2.1% headwind, and M&A impact is expected to be a 2% benefit for the quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing growth of 2.5% to 4.9%. Year-on-year currency net of hedging is expected to be a $0.02 headwind to EPS. Now, I would like to turn the call over back to Padraig for closing comments. Padraig?\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Bob. Before we end the call, I want to take this opportunity to highlight more of the Agilent team\u2019s tremendous work. This quarter, the World Economic Forum named our factories in Shanghai, China and Penang, Malaysia, as Global Lighthouse Networks. This recognizes Agilent for its breakthroughs in scaling AI, 3D printing, robotics, big-data analytics, and industrial internet of things. I was delighted to be able to accept those awards in person this year at the Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Shanghai and Penang are two of four Agilent manufacturing sites that have earned this prestigious distinction. In 2022, the Forum named our Singapore and Waldbronn, Germany, sites as Lighthouses. Still today, Agilent is the only analytical and clinical laboratory technology company in the world to be recognized by the World Economic Forum. Also during the quarter, Newsweek ranked Agilent No. 10 out of 600 on its 2025 list of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies up seven places from 2024. This is our sixth consecutive year on the prestigious list and is a recognition of Agilent being a leading sustainable lab partner to our customers. We are proud to be among the U.S. based companies who are making a positive global impact. At Agilent, we\u2019re only at the start of our Ignite Transformation journey and already we\u2019re seeing early benefits like the ones I described at the start of this call. In less than nine months, we\u2019ve made incredible changes that are improving our customers\u2019 productivity in an era when the pace of science is faster than ever. We\u2019re also becoming nimbler for our employees to better serve our customers. The outcome we\u2019re enabling is faster decision making so that we can accelerate innovation and create differentiated growth. And that, in turn, leads to industry-leading shareholder value. What we are doing at Agilent is turning a good company into a great one. We are committed to continuous improvement and adapting to changing market dynamics. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call. Let\u2019s move to Q&A. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Good afternoon, and thanks so much for taking the questions. So first up, I just kind of wanted to dig into some of this prudence that you mentioned in the guide. Obviously, you\u2019re talking up some of the progress that you guys have seen on your orderbook, but you\u2019re also acknowledging some of that headline risk that we\u2019ve seen on the funding side the last month and a half or so. So, could you quantify for us what level of headline risk can be really embedded into not only the fiscal 2Q guide, but the full-year guide at this point? And then have you seen any impact so far from customers and what are you really seeing from your sales teams that are boots on the ground?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, thanks for the question, Rachel. You know, our guide is a prudent one as we see a lot of changes happening. I will say from our customer base and particularly in our pharma base, activity has increased. The sentiment is increasing as we talk to our customers. Of course, things are, on the macro side are changing with NIH funding, which were less than 1% and, of course, tariffs, which we can mitigate. So, I would say our guide is as a prudent one, but we\u2019ll be able to monitor that as we go through the next quarters. But Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to add more detail.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Rachel, good afternoon. And to your point, around the prudence, we did raise, increase the range for our second quarter guide to roughly $40 million in between the low and the high. It\u2019s typically anywhere from $25 million to $30 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our NIH funding is roughly 1% at the maximum. And so, given the strength that we had in the first quarter and the fact that we\u2019re not raising guide, we feel that we\u2019re well compensating any potential downside. And to Padraig\u2019s point, we haven\u2019t seen any of that materially impact our business, and the activity in our customers.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. And then just on my follow-up, I hate to ask specifically on FX, but I think it\u2019s a question that a lot of us have on the line here. Can you just walk us through how much of the EPS number in the fiscal 2Q number especially is impacted by that FX given how much rates have really moved within the quarter? And then same idea just on the margin front, especially around that 2Q and for the full-year at all, what would that look like without these FX impacts? Thanks.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Rachel. So, let me give you a little more data. So for the full-year, that incremental $110 million is a $0.09 impact for the full-year, as I mentioned before, and that really is roughly a 50 basis point headwind to the overall company that we\u2019re covering. If I look at it for second quarter, it\u2019s about a $30 million, $32 million headwind in the quarter, roughly 2.1% and it\u2019s $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter, and roughly the same kind of impact from a profitability standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Ebie on for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one, can you talk through the opportunities within PFAS given the 70% growth you saw in the quarter? How much of this demand is coming from Europe following the packaging regulation? And then also, what do you think the growth contribution going forward could look like for this market?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, the demand for PFAS solutions remains extremely strong. During Q1, the solutions growth accounted for 75 basis points at a company level. And while most of the volume came on the environmental side, we\u2019re seeing actually exceptional growth in food and chemical materials as well. And the opportunity in Q1 grew 70%, but also if you look at that compared to Q4 was 50%, it was a big step up in growth rates. And, with the environmental market still accounts for the largest part of the PFAS revenues. We saw increased customer purchasing in the CAM market, with water discharge in some of those areas. And really we see, all regions doing well. We saw a little bit of a pause in China, which had a great sequential quarter of growth in PFAS. But that\u2019s normal as labs tool up on the equipment side. Europe was very strong and we expect that to be very strong. And, this is a market and this is an area where it\u2019s going to continue to morph and grow depending on new regulations and expanding into new modalities. And I will say, at the core of this is our 6595D triple quad, which is the leading sensitivity in the market, which helps with emerging PFAS characterization and of course our ability to offer consumables and workflow deployment services are really important as customers get set up quickly in their labs.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. And Ebie, just to build on what Padraig was saying, we ended last year approaching $100 million in revenue in the first quarter. We\u2019re well over that piece, as you can imagine. So I\u2019d say, I think we\u2019re uniquely positioned given all the things that Padraig just said and it\u2019s becoming even bigger component of our growth story going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you. And then can you talk through how much of the growth in instruments is due to true end market recovery versus replacements being driven by the Infinity III launch? And then any updates on how that launch is impacting your overall win rates?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I mean, if you look at our core on the LC and LCMS side in pharma, which is we grew high-single-digits globally and ex-China we grew double-digits actually on that. And, what we\u2019re seeing is a continued improvement in pharma\u2019s willingness on CapEx spending, undertaking opportunities in PFAS and GLP-1s as well. Infinity III has gone extremely well for us. We\u2019re seeing significant rise in win rates. We\u2019re seeing of course that the productivity gains that this system gives out is resonating with customers extremely well. And as we look at our, refresh of our installed base, whether it\u2019s 1100s, 1260s or 1290s, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. Some of that is actually spurred by end of support on the 1100 side in some areas. So, we\u2019re seeing our tech refresh momentum has really started around the Infinity III. So, really good momentum.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Padraig, maybe just on China. I know you talked about seeing an out-sized share from the China stimulus I know when we chatted a month ago, you guys were pretty positive on that piece as well. Felt like you were getting more than your fair share given where those dollars are going. It felt like a little more GCs and industrial. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing there, the traction? It feels like there could be some nice upside there. I know that there\u2019s more tenders coming as well. So it would be helpful to talk through China stimulus and the impact around GCs and the industrial piece.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No, thanks, Patrick. And we did saw a really nice uplift to our excellent performance and winning outside share of the tenders and the national stimulus program. The total stimulus demand for Q1 was around $35 million and we recognized all of that in the quarter. We won 50% of all stimulus orders. And with this round, our China team is now expecting the next round of stimulus to come later in the year. That\u2019s yet to be quantified. It is going to be broad and I think it\u2019s going to be slightly more fragmented in the type of customers. But the size of that round is really not clear as of yet. So, but I think, at this point, we\u2019re not assuming that all stimulus we booked in Q1 would be fully incremental for the year. I think that\u2019s important to say. We expect that some of that is likely pull-forward and our thinking is about [50%] (ph) of that is pull-forward. And we did not see a meaningful improvement in the underlying business in Q1. What I would say the China market is stable and we\u2019re otherwise maintaining our expectation on the base business, resulting in a modest increase for FY \u201825 expectations. And while we\u2019re increasing our expectations for the year, the total remains within our low-single-digit guide range.\nPatrick Donnelly: And Bob, are you rolling that second tender into the guide or will that be upside?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, that\u2019s a good question, Patrick. We\u2019re staying consistent with how we did it in the beginning of the year, which is, we have not rolled any incremental into the guide. So, that would be a source of upside, Patrick, once we understand more about what the scope and timing of that will be. We do believe that based on the folks, our team on the ground that it will happen in the second quarter of the second half of this year, whether that shows up in our second or third and fourth quarter, or by the end of the calendar year still be determined. But needless to say, we are very optimistic given our strong performance in this first cycle and the fact that we have a strong ability to produce all of our products in China before China.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just on the NASD business, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing there? I know last quarter you talked about high-single-digit growth expectations, maybe some potential for double-digits. So, we\u2019d love to hear the latest thoughts there. Any color commercial versus clinical would obviously be helpful as well.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I\u2019ll kick it off and I\u2019ll hand it over to Simon. So, very much as expected in Q1, demand continues to be very strong. No change in guidance for the year, which is guiding at high-single-digits and of course nudging to low-double-digit target. But Simon, you want to add more color?\nSimon May: Yes. I think you said it well Padraig, demand very much in-line with expectations, revenue profile also in-line with the expectation, the full-year outlook remains absolutely intact. I think we still have a dynamic in NASD, which bodes very well for the future where we\u2019ve got a lot of process qualification work for molecules that are headed towards the commercial space. And that coupled with the order intake patterns that we\u2019ve been seeing for quite a while now make us very enthusiastic for the future. So confident about the \u201825 guide and even more confident and enthusiastic about the longer-term.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. This is Jack on for Tycho. Appreciate you taking our question. I guess just one on the replacement cycle. Appreciate the color on Infinity III and kind of the influence there. I guess any other data points that spike out to help us understand where we sit today, and kind of better understand the shape and pace of the replacement cycle and how it could play out over the next two to three years?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I mean, LC replacements, it happens at different times within different installed bases and so on. What I will say about, us in terms of Infinity III, it really has kicked off that replacement cycle. And, what we\u2019ve seen is that typically, the replacement cycle is about nine to 12 months. And because of our installed base and a lot of 1100s out there that are some of those are coming to end of support, it really has created momentum around it. So, we expect that to be a steady replacement cycle. We don\u2019t expect the super cycle in any particular quarter, but as we move forward, our installed base will move with it. What I will say as well, we\u2019ve made significant improvements in our lifecycle management process. So how we can look at where the installed base is, how we can inform customers for better productivity and so on. And the good news is Infinity III has all those capabilities.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, maybe just to build on what Padraig is saying is, I would say we\u2019re in the still in the early stages of that recovery. We had a very strong performance in Q1 with the uptake of Infinity III. The feedback continues to be very positive. And I would also look at when we look at the average age of our installed base is still older than normal, and so, we\u2019re very excited about this. I would also say that order growth outpaced revenue growth in the quarter. So again, another positive instance. And that\u2019s on top of overcoming Chinese Lunar New Year, that\u2019s across the board. So, certainly, early days very positive for all the things that Padraig was talking about in the call. And I think there\u2019s a long runway here, for us to be able to take advantage of not only our own installed base, but also, competitive installed base as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Padraig, you mentioned, I think early in the script, some changes in the management layers within Agilent. Is there any additional color you can share on what you\u2019re doing? And then just is there any associated savings, attached to that that you would call out? Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks, Jack. So, first of all, we layered we talked about our new organizational structure at the Investor Day at JPMorgan. And one of the key elements of our customer centric strategy we introduced was becoming more nimble. That\u2019s going to speed up decision making and also increase innovation. And these changes are absolutely critical to our strategy and we know they\u2019re going to deliver many benefits to our customers. So, what we\u2019re really doing is we\u2019re looking at layers in the organization where we can flatten a little bit, increase our span of control so we can improve our decision making and also get a better coverage in our management layer. And while I would say the focus of this is truly strategic, it really is leading with our strategy. There will be some cost reductions associated with these changes later in the year. And that\u2019s where you have those baked into our guide.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, just if you recall, when we talked about the Ignite savings at the beginning of the year, we talked about some being in the second half, more in the second half. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll see the activities that we\u2019re going through right now.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And then, it\u2019d be great to get an update on BIOVECTRA. It looks like that M&A added $26 million of sales in the quarter. Has your target for the year changed at all? I think I heard $145 million in the model. And can you just talk about how things are going there? Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I\u2019ll pass this one to Simon to take.\nSimon May: Yes. Thanks for the question. I\u2019d say overall, as we are going through the integration process with BIOVECTRA, we\u2019re increasingly excited about what we\u2019re seeing there. I think the more we get under the hood, the more the capabilities that we have there are resonating with our internal experts and also with our customers. We think it\u2019s still very early inning and we\u2019re absolutely in the sweet spot there with those capabilities and relative to where the book is going with therapeutic modalities. We were slightly soft on revenue in the first quarter. The focus there is really very heavily on bringing certain aspects of the operation up to the Agilent NASD standards with process and quality, and that\u2019s progressing really well. But then with regard to the full year guide, we\u2019re holding to the previous guidance and so no change there.\nJack Meehan: Okay. Thank you, Simon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess, Bob, when we report again on your book-to-bill commentary here being about one versus seasonally being built sub-1x, is that being driven by stimulus or perhaps timing of the Chinese New Year? Maybe talk about the book-to-bill trends and what is that signaling?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Vijay, it\u2019s Bob. Yes, actually the Lunar New Year didn\u2019t have a big impact on that. Actually, I would take that as a sign of the continued recovery, particularly in the instrumentation market. We did have an impact or a contribution from the Lunar New Year, but the real big area is both LC and LCMS. So, typically what we see is just because the way our fiscal year is that our first fiscal year because January is the last month of the quarter the instrument book-to-bill is typically lower than one. And so the fact that it\u2019s above one is a very positive sign from our perspective that recovery continues. And as we were saying, it\u2019s really been led by some of the new products in the unique attributes of our, the Infinity III portfolio and has given us or allowed us to have renewed conversations with customers and so forth.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Padraig, maybe one for you on, I think I heard you mention you\u2019ve identified a few hundred million dollars worth of replacement opportunity. I guess, what is the average age of the fleet? And when you do that math, what is incremental of that few hundred million versus a normal replacement cycle? And when you think about the attach rates on services and chemistry, do you feel like that part of the business is growing mid-to-high singles or where are we on services and consumables?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I\u2019ll take the first step piece and I\u2019ll hand it over to Angelica to give more color on the services and consumables. But we\u2019re older than the median, I would say, of the age of the installed base. And the installed base is very large, very disparate, a lot of different equipment in it. So, we expect that we\u2019re going to see the pace of that change, continually improve throughout the year. And then there\u2019s a huge opportunity there in terms of opportunity for replacements. And also when that comes, of course, we have attach rate with the new Infinity III both on the services on the consumer side. So, I would say as well, just to mention that we did see an improvement at the end of year orders. If not back to pre-COVID days, but there was a sequential improvement in terms of December orders in terms of budget flush versus the previous year, which again was in large part about install base change. And I would say when I talk to lab managers out there and we talk to, high level procurement people there\u2019s a lot of pent up demand for, instrument changes. Lab managers are really pressing that. And we do see the purse strings loosening a bit within our pharma customers. But Angelica on service and consumables?\nAngelica Riemann: Yes. Great. Thanks, Padraig. To add to what you\u2019ve already said, it is going to the replacement cycle is going to occur over a period of time, and it\u2019s probably going to be a mix of some incremental, placements of new instruments as well as replacing some of the aging instruments on the lab bench. And what that really allows us to do is continue our focus on increasing our ability to connect services and consumables as those new instruments are being put into service, and we know that, that motion allows for greater and longer customer lifetime value both in how the customer is using that instrument but also in terms of the continued revenue stream that that generates for Agilent. So, there is upside and incremental opportunity, for sure. Understood.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Bob, can you just help us understand what\u2019s going on with gross margins, down over 130 basis points in the first quarter? Was that in line with your expectations? How much did currency affect that? And what are you expecting kind of the next few quarters?\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes, Brandon, what I would say is if we looked at the bottom line, operating profit was in line. Gross margin was a little lower just because of some of the mix of products. It wasn\u2019t anything material and I would expect that to improve throughout the course of the year. If you can imagine, with a large stimulus in China that did have some pressure on our margins at the gross margin level, but very profitable at the operating profit margin. And currency did have an impact as well in Q1, and that impact was roughly 20-30 basis points in the quarter for the total company. And I\u2019d expect some of that to continue throughout the course of the year. We do get some benefit because we do hedge, but still the drop through of that is greater on the gross margin. So, the one thing I would say, Brandon, to offset that is we were actually pleased with the pricing. Padraig mentioned about the pricing. It actually was trending a bit higher than what we had expected in Q1 and are expecting that to continue through the course of the year.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, it\u2019d be great if you could get an update just on the pathology and genomics pieces and how those performed in the first quarter. I think genomics is actually up in the fourth quarter. Can you share an update? It would be helpful. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I\u2019m going to pass this one to Simon.\nSimon May: Yes. I said genomics was puts and takes in the first quarter. We saw some negative impacts from the funding situation in the U.S. with academia and government. And then on the flip side, we continue to see really strong traction with our Magnus automated NGS prep system that\u2019s on a very strong growth trajectory. And the way the chemistry as well still is pretty a pretty small acorn, but the customer adoption there is looking pretty strong. So, as we look to the full year, I still think we see a path to return to growth in genomics. But again, the near-term headwinds, at least with academic and government funding slightly outweighed the positives from Magnus in the first quarter.\nRobert W. McMahon: And the diagnostics and clinical overall grew 7% and pathology was flat year-over-year, but we see very steady growth rates as we go through the year on that side.\nBrandon Couillard: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Padraig and team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, if you could just elaborate a little bit on the China stimulus, we were expecting more orders and maybe more continued orders. And so I\u2019m just trying to understand, so why are you expecting it in the second and the rest of the instrumentations and growth from stimulus potentially in the second half? Maybe can you elaborate, what you saw? What are you hearing from the ground in China?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, the stimulus order was within the food area, within the Chinese customs and government departments. And it was very broad based in terms of instruments that actually held most of our platforms in it. We won 50% of that stimulus order, which is around $35 million and was recognized essentially all of that was recognized in the quarter. That\u2019s a very extremely high, win rate. And of course, we think it\u2019s not all of that is incremental. We believe about half of it is kind of run rate pull forward. Half of that is incremental. And, but it shows when these stimulus come in, the Agilent team can really win its oversized share of it. And as I said before, you know, we\u2019re expecting more stimulus, which we haven\u2019t baked into the guide in the second half. But rest assured, when that arises, the Agilent team will be there to help customers.\nSimon May: Yes. Hey, Puneet, to build on what Padraig is saying, I actually see this as a really positive that we were able to not only get that revenue in, the orders in and actually deliver it, it\u2019s a real testament to the Agilent team. And so it actually gives me increased confidence that when the orders come in, we will get more than our fair share in the second half of the year. So, I think we still feel very optimistic about not just this year, but, you know, if you remember, this is a multi-year kind of stimulus program. And, so, we feel very good about the momentum that we have. I wouldn\u2019t look at it quarter-to-quarter. I look at it year-over-year.\nPadraig McDonnell: And just maybe adding one point. I mean, what is absolutely crucial for those orders, to come in is having met in China capabilities and having our ability now to make all our platforms within China for China is really a significant advantage for us.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. And then question on the margin side. With Ignite efforts, can you elaborate the margin contribution? You talked about pricing on one end, number of cost efforts and also reducing some of the management changes that you have in place. So just wondering how should we think about the margin contribution? Do you have a target, this year from Ignite? Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: I\u2019ll start it off and I\u2019ll hand it over to Bob. So yes, of course, we have a very well defined program as we go through the year. Actually, Ignite is a three year program. And what we said is over the three years, [72] (ph) basis points plus in terms of margin expansion. And of course, all of this doesn\u2019t happen all at once, right? So we\u2019ve seen early benefits both from the procurement, direct and indirect procurement side and from pricing in terms of what we\u2019re seeing. But of course, we\u2019ll see more in the second half and as we go into next year. But Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to give more color on that.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. I was going to say, we\u2019re on track with what we had talked about at the beginning of the year Puneet, which was 50 to 70 basis points this year. We\u2019re going to have to work harder for that because of some of the currency. But pricing has held up here in the quarter and we\u2019re on track, as Padraig mentioned for some of the other areas.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. When we caught up with you guys in January, it sounded like similar to the rest of the peer group, you had a strong December in terms of the instrument budget flush, especially in the pharma end market. And, I guess I\u2019m just wondering if one, I want to confirm that was the case that the end of the fiscal year came together strongly. And if so, it would be interesting to hear if there\u2019s anything, interesting that occurred in terms of a particular rebound in specific instrument categories, specific geographies, specific end markets, and then kind of building off of that. Was January normal? Or did you, you know, kind of go into the second topic I wanted to cover given the change in administration? If December felt a little more normal, did January feel maybe less normal given all the uncertainty in terms of pharma regs, academic funding, food and water testing. Any commentary on all of those things would be really helpful.\nPadraig McDonnell: Okay. Thanks. So, I\u2019ll start off and I\u2019ll hand over to Bob. So, it was certainly as we talked before December, it did play out as we expect us. We did have that strong momentum. And what was driving that, overall demand, I would say particularly around Infinity III, but also we talked about PFAS testing and including, also what we\u2019re seeing in the GLP-I areas. And January new administration comes in a lot of changes. And of course, we\u2019re mitigating those changes as we go through it. The only area where we\u2019ve seen some softness is really in Academia, with NIH funding where things have really slowed down a bit. But of course, that\u2019s a very small part of our business and it\u2019s not within the guide on us. In pharma, when we talk to our customers, actually there\u2019s a lot of questions, you see a lot of discussions around Aira, etcetera, what changes might happen about international pricing index, etcetera. But I would say that hasn\u2019t impacted on the pharma side. We\u2019re still seeing a steady business coming out of that side, but everybody\u2019s really, really watching that. On the PFAS side, just going back to the pharma side as well, people were talking about FDA, changes within the FDA. I think that hit more of the medical device companies, areas within that expertise, but we haven\u2019t seen anything on us yet. And within PFAS, that business continues to be strong. We still see it in January, there\u2019s been no change in that as it happens. So, it\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to continue to watch very, very closely, hugely dynamic. But I would say January is a steady progression from December.\nDoug Schenkel: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. You mentioned a couple of times that you saw an improvement in pharma CapEx. And what I\u2019m curious about is how much of that improvement was narrowly relevant to QAQC versus broader and inclusive of R&D functions in pharma and other product categories in your portfolio like cell analysis?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, I\u2019ll kick it off and maybe hand it to Simon on this one. So, we\u2019re of course, we have heavy fleets and a lot of capabilities when QAQC and development for QAQC. So we saw that across the board on that side. I would say in R&D you see a lot of shifts in terms of where customers are spending money. So, we did actually see a good continuation of positivity on that side. But in the pharma QAQC and the development areas of labs, we\u2019ve seen continued, I would say, steadiness and incremental strength in it driven around a replacement of fleets and driven by the Infinity III. But Simon, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that.\nSimon May: Very little to add on. There was a reference in the question to cell analysis tools and there\u2019s a look at that overall. And actually, so on the academic and government side, we\u2019ve had some impact there in cell analysis with our lower end instrumentation where although at company level, the exposure is very minimal within cell analysis, it\u2019s a little higher. But generally speaking, the funnels are robust in biopharma across the entire continuum. We\u2019re seeing really nice adoption of our NovoCyte Opteon platform, the spectral flow cytometer and the citation C10 is also performing really well. So a few puts and takes in cell analysis.\nDan Leonard: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then a follow-up question. I think, Padraig, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you\u2019ve taken specific actions in response to the tariff talk. Can you elaborate on that?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, no problem. So, we have a very diverse manufacturing capability around and if you talk about the three areas for tariffs, we talked about in Mexico, we have no manufacturing. In Canada, we do have manufacturing with BIOVECTRA, but it\u2019s about 30%, I think is, put into the U.S. And of course, in China, we have in China, China on it. So we believe the overall impact is about $5 million and we actually believe that\u2019s very mitigated bodes down to much less than that and we\u2019re working on it. Just to give you a sense of it, we were able to shift our supply chain pretty quickly in areas from, say, China back into the U.S. and, into Singapore as well, which really is very mitigatable.\nDan Leonard: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with BofA. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks guys. Maybe a little bit of cleanup, but you\u2019ve touched on this a couple of times in terms of the academic government. I just kind of want to make sure I understand the timing of it. If I\u2019m just going to go back to the slide deck, the negative seven in the quarter, you call out softness globally and then anticipated slowdown in government spending, impacts willingness to some customers are staying. So, is this things you started seeing back in November, December? I\u2019m just trying to think of the timing of what was happening in the quarter as it relates to election, inauguration, all of that. Any clarity there would be helpful.\nRobert W. McMahon: Yes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. What we saw actually was a pretty consistent performance across all of the regions. So, they were all down. So that\u2019s what we were talking about when we did see globally. We did see maybe a slight more in January incremental softness towards the end as people were trying to figure out the NAH activity. I wouldn\u2019t say that necessarily is super material for us. And as you know, the Academia and government can be kind of lumpy at times. So, the one area that I would say got disproportionate impact actually was China and a lot of that is some of the impact of the timing of the Lunar New Year. And so, I think that they were the most negative for the full Q1. And that we have a slightly larger exposure in Academia and government in China than we do relative to the rest of the world. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. Hopefully, that kind of clarifies, kind of what we were seeing.\nMichael Ryskin: Yes. It does. It does. And I think, I mean, just right now in response to, I think Dan\u2019s question, you\u2019re talking about cell analysis specifically. Is that just another area where you have overlap where it\u2019s concentrated in a handful of different parts of the portfolio? I imagine there\u2019s not a lot of GCs going into academic and government labs.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. That\u2019s the true statement. And again in cell analysis the way I\u2019d characterize it is that we began to see hesitancy in Academia and government in the run up to the election last year. People were kind of in wait and see mode to see what happened with the election. Now what we\u2019re starting to see, of course, is that the impacts are real. And just to say, again, in cell analysis, we\u2019ve got proportionally higher exposure there in Academia and government than we do in many, if not all, other parts of our portfolio. So, your statement there about the relative impact is a true one and we don\u2019t see that elsewhere.\nMichael Ryskin: All right. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Eve Burstein with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nEve Burstein: Thanks a lot for taking the question. This has been asked a couple of ways, but maybe just to follow-up on Mike\u2019s question for academic and government. You said you were starting to see a little bit of softness at the end of January. How is that trending into February? Can you just give us a take now where you stand today?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. What I would say is, that\u2019s why we have a little wider guidance in the Q2 guide between the low and the high. And we have, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s any materially different than what we saw in January from a trends perspective. It hasn\u2019t deteriorated, but we\u2019re just being prudent there from a standpoint of, what potentially would be there. And then, for the full year, we\u2019re not changing our guidance.\nEve Burstein: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. And then we\u2019ve talked quite a bit about the LC replacement cycle. Within GC, is there opportunity for an upcycle here as well? You\u2019ve mentioned several times that in LC different customers, different applications are going to improve at different times. But how do you anticipate GC playing out, through the rest of the year in terms of improvement pace timing? And can you just give a little color there?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No. That\u2019s a great question. And of course, GC replacement is a different timing than LCs, because of the technology. But I\u2019m going to ask Mike Zhang to give some color here.\nMike Zhang: Yes. Thank you, Padraig. Obviously, we have, strong leadership in the GC market and we\u2019re very, very strong install base. And we actually have introduced a new GCMS to the market and we\u2019re seeing very strong response from customers. So, yes, we\u2019re very optimistic about opportunities, but certainly it will be again it\u2019s over time, it\u2019s annual long term opportunity. So, we\u2019re very excited about that.\nEve Burstein: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And Mr. Ahuja, I turn the call back over to you.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that we would like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As you saw in our press release, we had a very solid start to the year, exceeding our expectations for core revenue growth and EPS. Before diving into the details, I want to first follow-up on conversations I had with many of you starting at our Analyst and Investor Day in December at the New York Stock Exchange and provide an update on progress of our Ignite Transformation. We\u2019ve stated that Ignite is for our customers, employees, and shareholders. For customers, we want to create a seamless experience across Agilent products, software, and services. For our employees, we want to become nimbler and reduce complexity to enhance our ability to serve our customers. And for shareholders, we want to deliver industry-leading shareholder value through differentiated growth. We have set targets to grow core revenues between 5% and 7% annually, expand our operating margin by 50 to 100 plus basis points per year, and deliver double-digit EPS growth. Right now, I want to share three notable accomplishments from the Ignite Transformation that focus on setting a new pricing mechanisms, elevating our digital ecosystem, and identifying procurement opportunities. First, the creation of an Enterprise strategic-pricing organization that will focus on setting our standard approach for pricing across the entire solution set with the customer and not just at a tactical bottoms-up product level. Second, our digital ecosystem, a critical enabler in our evolved strategy we unveiled at Investor Day continues to be a key area of investment for us. Already, we have made meaningful improvements to our website, upgrading the user experience on our e-commerce platform by making it easier to find and purchase the products our customers need, helping driving topline growth. In Q1, our progress continued with digital orders growing high-single-digits. And third, our procurement teams have challenged our historical approach and are identifying significant cost-savings opportunities in many of Agilent\u2019s functions. Also related to our Ignite Transformation, we\u2019re assessing our organizational health. On my first day as CEO, I promised our employees we would become a nimbler organization to make decisions faster and accelerate innovation in service of our customers. As a result, we are removing some management layers and increasing spans of control. This is a continuation of our new organizational structure we announced in late November. Through that reorganization, we\u2019re seeing our business leaders in lockstep on our strategy and transformation. This alignment enables us to make business decisions faster on priorities and trade-offs. As my leadership team and I look forward, we are focused on growing Agilent. A foundational element of growth is innovation, innovation that our customers want. Every time I visit a customer in any part of the world, they say the same thing; they want to partner with Agilent for better outcomes. That\u2019s what differentiates Agilent, the deep scientific knowledge of our customer-facing team members that our competitors simply can\u2019t duplicate. Customers want everything from the ability to parse massive amounts of data in seconds, to automating more tasks so they can focus on complex scientific challenges. In essence, they want to increase their productivity. That\u2019s why driving lab productivity is among our key priorities. You can see evidence of this in our collaborative agreement with Zurich-based ABB Robotics to produce automated laboratory solutions, ones that will help our customers find new ways of improved workflows and make operations more efficient and flexible. These are customers across multiple markets, including pharma, biotech, energy, and food. Together with ABB, Agilent can transform the customer lab operations by making workflow processes for research, development, and quality control faster and more efficient. The goal is for all instruments, robots, and software to be interoperable, which is crucial to significantly boosting productivity for our customers. Our customers want to buy whole product solutions not just a single instrument. To illustrate that, our Infinity III series that we introduced in October has seen great adoption from all our customers. As a reminder, the Infinity III has an advanced automation that simplifies our customers\u2019 daily routines and is compatible with previous generations, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And that has become a differentiator. Customers are saying that the backward compatibility combined with the modularity of Agilent systems allows them to decide how to upgrade and refresh their instruments. Plus, they\u2019re telling us that they\u2019re choosing Agilent because of our longstanding quality and technology leadership that\u2019s been further enforced with the Infinity III. And the Agilent InfinityLab LC Solutions are certified by My Green Lab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. We continue to see strong momentum and growth in our sales funnel for the Infinity III because of its advanced automation that empowers our customers to be more productive and because of InfinityLab Assist, our automation software that provides on-board intelligence. So, our customers are not simply buying a platform, but a whole product solution. Just as exciting is that the great success of our Infinity III provides Agilent an incredible opportunity for us to upgrade our customers\u2019 instruments. And it\u2019s already happening across our legacy LC platforms, representing an opportunity in the hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming years. Now, I\u2019d like to highlight some key aspects of our Q1 results. As you can see from our press release, we drove topline year-over-year growth while macro market trends, such as CapEx spending, continue to improve. Our revenue of $1.681 billion increased 1% over the same quarter in FY \u201824. This result exceeded our expectations and was led by excellent growth in PFAS and capturing an outsized share of the China stimulus awards. Our instrument book-to-bill was greater than one in Q1, a quarter when it\u2019s typically less than one. This is another sign of market recovery, but more importantly, it\u2019s a testament to our intense customer focus with products such as the highly successful Infinity III and our success driving our market-leading position in China. Additionally, we exceeded expectations in all regions and end markets except for Academia and Government. In our end markets, revenue was led by Food, which grew 9% driven by our success in capturing stimulus orders in China. In China, our accelerating share gains were apparent in recording a win rate of more than 50% on stimulus-related tenders. With our long history in the region elevated by our local manufacturing capabilities, we are well-positioned to expand our market leadership in China. Now, let me talk about our businesses and some growth vectors in each. Our Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group grew 1% in the quarter, reporting $647 million. Performance was driven by a nice result in our LC and LCMS instruments, which grew high-single-digits during the quarter on the heels of our Infinity III launch. Within LDG, we remain focused on the integration of BIOVECTRA and we are delighted by the response we\u2019re hearing from our existing and potential customers who are interested in leveraging BIOVECTRA\u2019s unique capabilities and Agilent\u2019s expertise. It\u2019s clear that BIOVECTRA\u2019s capabilities are in the sweet spot of tremendous markets with a terrific growth potential. The Agilent CrossLab Group grew 3%, reporting $696 million, which was in-line with our expectations, led by services. We are especially excited about the new ACG that now includes services, automation, consumables, and software and informatics. Software and informatics are among our key priorities, and we\u2019ve had an overwhelmingly positive response to both our InfinityLab Assist automation software and our OpenLab CDS. The InfinityLab automation software offers remote notifications, trouble shootings, diagnostics, and maintenance that paves the way for a fully-automated, digital lab. And our OpenLab CDS provides time-saving steps in analysis, interpretation, and reporting workflows while technical controls ensure work quality, effective records management, and enhanced data security. In short, software is an incredible area of opportunity for us that we are poised to capitalize upon. Already, customers are telling us that InfinityLab Assist and OpenLab offer differentiated functionality and solutions in high-throughput environments. Our Applied Markets Group reported $338 million in the quarter, a 2% decline better than expected related to a strong China stimulus orders. We are very pleased with our team\u2019s ability to compete and win these tenders. We continue to invest in the Applied Markets for next-generation technology innovation and, as I said, support our customers with lab productivity. Every customer we meet has expressed a desire to partner with Agilent to make better use of their instrument fleets to integrate with front-end solutions. And, we\u2019re happy to help them find ways to create customized solutions so they can deliver products faster. Before I hand over to Bob, I want to address topics that have been in the news of late. Regarding the recent news around tariffs, we have a diversified supply chain with a manufacturing presence in all major regions of the world. Our teams already are taking action to mitigate the impacts on our business. In terms of potential reductions to NIH funding, as we\u2019ve shared with you before, our exposure to NIH-related programs is limited to around 1% of our revenue. We currently believe the forecasted impact is manageable within our current guidance. Bob, will now delve deeper on our Q1 results, as well as our outlook for Q2. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Bob?"

                            "speaker": "Robert W. McMahon",
                            "text": "Thanks Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then cover our updated full-year and second quarter guidance. As Padraig mentioned, Q1 revenue was $1.68 billion, just above the top-end of guidance despite the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter. On a core basis, we posted growth of 1.2%, beating expectations. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year impacts, core growth is estimated to be just over 3%. On a reported basis, growth was 1.4%. Currency had a negative impact of 1.4 percentage points, which was over one percentage point higher than estimated at the start of the quarter. And M&A contributed 1.6%. Padraig already discussed our business group results, so I\u2019ll focus on deeper details about our end markets. We exceeded expectations in all of our end markets except for our smallest one, Academia and Government. Our business in the Food market grew 9%, benefiting from our excellent performance in China\u2019s national stimulus program. In Environmental and Forensics, we grew 6% as we continue to leverage our best-in-class PFAS workflow solutions to grow our market-leading position. We continue to capitalize on the strong demand for PFAS testing that we are seeing globally. Our 6495 triple quad LCMS is the most complete instrument in the PFAS testing market with a specific performance edge in small and fragile molecules where many of the emerging PFAS exist. Along with our new offerings in PFAS-specific consumables and our workflow deployment services, Agilent provides the fastest, highest-quality and most reliable way for customers to add or expand PFAS testing capabilities in their labs. Now looking across all end markets, PFAS grew 70% in the quarter, contributing 75 basis points of growth to the company. Pharma was flat during the quarter, with low-single-digit growth ex-China offset by a high-single-digit decline in China. Globally biopharma and small molecule performed roughly in-line with the overall market. In Chemical and Advanced Materials, revenue declined 2% with growth ex-China offset by a high-teens decline in China, which was mostly impacted by the timing of the Lunar New Year. Our business in the Diagnostics and Clinical end market grew 7%, led by strong results in the Americas and Europe. Academia and Government, our smallest market, saw a decline of 7%, with soft results around the globe. Now moving on to our regional performance, the Americas grew 3%, Europe grew 2%, and Asia ex-China grew 2%, all slightly ahead of expectations. China revenue declined 4%, also better than expectations, on the strength of our stimulus performance. For your models, we estimate that Lunar New Year was a $10 million revenue headwind in the quarter, which we expect to come back in the second quarter. This compares to a $25 million favorable Lunar New Year impact in the first quarter of last year, so combined a 2 percentage point year-on-year impact. Now, let\u2019s move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 54.7% in the quarter, down versus last year primarily due to mix, currency and the Lunar New Year timing. We drove operating margins of 25.1%, roughly in-line with our expectations, despite currency headwinds. While down versus last year, we expect improvement throughout the year as the results of our Ignite Transformation continue to deliver. And below the line, our net interest expense was better than expected as was our tax rate of 12.5%. And we had $287 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.31. That was ahead of our expectations and up 2% from a year ago, growing slightly faster than revenue. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $431 million in the quarter, and we invested $97 million in capital expenditures. We purchased $90 million in shares and paid out $71 million through dividends during the quarter. And, we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.0. In summary, we had a good start to the year, and expect continued steady improvement in the market through the year. Now, let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the fiscal year and the second quarter. While we exceeded core growth expectations for Q1, we are maintaining our core growth guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% for the year. This guidance incorporates an element of prudence reflecting the uncertainty over the U.S. federal funding environment, even though it is a small part of our business. However, we are adjusting our full-year reported revenue to be in the range of $6.68 billion to $6.76 billion to reflect the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. If you recall our initial guidance back in November incorporated only a very modest FX headwind. Since then, the U.S. dollar has appreciated and based on current exchange rates, we are now projecting an incremental $110 million in currency headwinds relative to our prior guidance. Currency is now expected to represent a 1.9% headwind for the year versus a prior 20 basis point headwind. We also have left our M&A guidance unchanged at plus 2.0% to 2.2% revenue impact for the year. Full-year, non-GAAP earnings per share are unchanged at $5.54 to $5.61, representing an increase of 4.7% to 6.0%. Relative to our prior guide, currency net of hedging is an estimated additional $0.09 headwind for the year, which we are covering. This assumes flat other income and expense, a 12.5% tax rate, and $286 million diluted shares outstanding. Now for the second quarter, we are guiding to revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion. This range is a bit wider than we typically use for the upcoming quarter, reflecting the uncertainty around U.S. Federal Government spending. This range represents an increase of 2.5% to 5% growth on a core basis and an increase of 2.4% to 4.9% growth on a reported basis. Currency is a 2.1% headwind, and M&A impact is expected to be a 2% benefit for the quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing growth of 2.5% to 4.9%. Year-on-year currency net of hedging is expected to be a $0.02 headwind to EPS. Now, I would like to turn the call over back to Padraig for closing comments. Padraig?"

This quarter, the World Economic Forum named our factories in Shanghai, China and Penang, Malaysia, as Global Lighthouse Networks. This recognizes Agilent for its breakthroughs in scaling AI, 3D printing, robotics, big-data analytics, and industrial internet of things. I was delighted to be able to accept those awards in person this year at the Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Shanghai and Penang are two of four Agilent manufacturing sites that have earned this prestigious distinction. In 2022, the Forum named our Singapore and Waldbronn, Germany, sites as Lighthouses. Still today, Agilent is the only analytical and clinical laboratory technology company in the world to be recognized by the World Economic Forum. Also during the quarter, Newsweek ranked Agilent No. 10 out of 600 on its 2025 list of America\u2019s Most Responsible Companies up seven places from 2024. This is our sixth consecutive year on the prestigious list and is a recognition of Agilent being a leading sustainable lab partner to our customers. We are proud to be among the U.S. based companies who are making a positive global impact. At Agilent, we\u2019re only at the start of our Ignite Transformation journey and already we\u2019re seeing early benefits like the ones I described at the start of this call. In less than nine months, we\u2019ve made incredible changes that are improving our customers\u2019 productivity in an era when the pace of science is faster than ever. We\u2019re also becoming nimbler for our employees to better serve our customers. The outcome we\u2019re enabling is faster decision making so that we can accelerate innovation and create differentiated growth. And that, in turn, leads to industry-leading shareholder value. What we are doing at Agilent is turning a good company into a great one. We are committed to continuous improvement and adapting to changing market dynamics. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call.

So first up, I just kind of wanted to dig into some of this prudence that you mentioned in the guide. Obviously, you\u2019re talking up some of the progress that you guys have seen on your orderbook, but you\u2019re also acknowledging some of that headline risk that we\u2019ve seen on the funding side the last month and a half or so. So, could you quantify for us what level of headline risk can be really embedded into not only the fiscal 2Q guide, but the full-year guide at this point? And then have you seen any impact so far from customers and what are you really seeing from your sales teams that are boots on the ground?"

I will say from our customer base and particularly in our pharma base, activity has increased. The sentiment is increasing as we talk to our customers. Of course, things are, on the macro side are changing with NIH funding, which were less than 1% and, of course, tariffs, which we can mitigate. So, I would say our guide is as a prudent one, but we\u2019ll be able to monitor that as we go through the next quarters. But Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to add more detail."

And to your point, around the prudence, we did raise, increase the range for our second quarter guide to roughly $40 million in between the low and the high. It\u2019s typically anywhere from $25 million to $30 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our NIH funding is roughly 1% at the maximum. And so, given the strength that we had in the first quarter and the fact that we\u2019re not raising guide, we feel that we\u2019re well compensating any potential downside. And to Padraig\u2019s point, we haven\u2019t seen any of that materially impact our business, and the activity in our customers."

Can you just walk us through how much of the EPS number in the fiscal 2Q number especially is impacted by that FX given how much rates have really moved within the quarter? And then same idea just on the margin front, especially around that 2Q and for the full-year at all, what would that look like without these FX impacts? Thanks."

So for the full-year, that incremental $110 million is a $0.09 impact for the full-year, as I mentioned before, and that really is roughly a 50 basis point headwind to the overall company that we\u2019re covering. If I look at it for second quarter, it\u2019s about a $30 million, $32 million headwind in the quarter, roughly 2.1% and it\u2019s $0.02 to $0.03 in the quarter, and roughly the same kind of impact from a profitability standpoint."

So, the first one, can you talk through the opportunities within PFAS given the 70% growth you saw in the quarter? How much of this demand is coming from Europe following the packaging regulation?

During Q1, the solutions growth accounted for 75 basis points at a company level. And while most of the volume came on the environmental side, we\u2019re seeing actually exceptional growth in food and chemical materials as well. And the opportunity in Q1 grew 70%, but also if you look at that compared to Q4 was 50%, it was a big step up in growth rates. And, with the environmental market still accounts for the largest part of the PFAS revenues. We saw increased customer purchasing in the CAM market, with water discharge in some of those areas. And really we see, all regions doing well. We saw a little bit of a pause in China, which had a great sequential quarter of growth in PFAS. But that\u2019s normal as labs tool up on the equipment side. Europe was very strong and we expect that to be very strong. And, this is a market and this is an area where it\u2019s going to continue to morph and grow depending on new regulations and expanding into new modalities. And I will say, at the core of this is our 6595D triple quad, which is the leading sensitivity in the market, which helps with emerging PFAS characterization and of course our ability to offer consumables and workflow deployment services are really important as customers get set up quickly in their labs."

And, what we\u2019re seeing is a continued improvement in pharma\u2019s willingness on CapEx spending, undertaking opportunities in PFAS and GLP-1s as well. Infinity III has gone extremely well for us. We\u2019re seeing significant rise in win rates. We\u2019re seeing of course that the productivity gains that this system gives out is resonating with customers extremely well. And as we look at our, refresh of our installed base, whether it\u2019s 1100s, 1260s or 1290s, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. Some of that is actually spurred by end of support on the 1100 side in some areas. So, we\u2019re seeing our tech refresh momentum has really started around the Infinity III.

And we did saw a really nice uplift to our excellent performance and winning outside share of the tenders and the national stimulus program. The total stimulus demand for Q1 was around $35 million and we recognized all of that in the quarter. We won 50% of all stimulus orders. And with this round, our China team is now expecting the next round of stimulus to come later in the year. That\u2019s yet to be quantified. It is going to be broad and I think it\u2019s going to be slightly more fragmented in the type of customers. But the size of that round is really not clear as of yet. So, but I think, at this point, we\u2019re not assuming that all stimulus we booked in Q1 would be fully incremental for the year. I think that\u2019s important to say. We expect that some of that is likely pull-forward and our thinking is about [50%] (ph) of that is pull-forward. And we did not see a meaningful improvement in the underlying business in Q1. What I would say the China market is stable and we\u2019re otherwise maintaining our expectation on the base business, resulting in a modest increase for FY \u201825 expectations. And while we\u2019re increasing our expectations for the year, the total remains within our low-single-digit guide range."

So, that would be a source of upside, Patrick, once we understand more about what the scope and timing of that will be. We do believe that based on the folks, our team on the ground that it will happen in the second quarter of the second half of this year, whether that shows up in our second or third and fourth quarter, or by the end of the calendar year still be determined. But needless to say, we are very optimistic given our strong performance in this first cycle and the fact that we have a strong ability to produce all of our products in China before China."

What I will say about, us in terms of Infinity III, it really has kicked off that replacement cycle. And, what we\u2019ve seen is that typically, the replacement cycle is about nine to 12 months. And because of our installed base and a lot of 1100s out there that are some of those are coming to end of support, it really has created momentum around it. So, we expect that to be a steady replacement cycle. We don\u2019t expect the super cycle in any particular quarter, but as we move forward, our installed base will move with it. What I will say as well, we\u2019ve made significant improvements in our lifecycle management process. So how we can look at where the installed base is, how we can inform customers for better productivity and so on. And the good news is Infinity III has all those capabilities."

We had a very strong performance in Q1 with the uptake of Infinity III. The feedback continues to be very positive. And I would also look at when we look at the average age of our installed base is still older than normal, and so, we\u2019re very excited about this. I would also say that order growth outpaced revenue growth in the quarter. So again, another positive instance. And that\u2019s on top of overcoming Chinese Lunar New Year, that\u2019s across the board. So, certainly, early days very positive for all the things that Padraig was talking about in the call. And I think there\u2019s a long runway here, for us to be able to take advantage of not only our own installed base, but also, competitive installed base as well."

And these changes are absolutely critical to our strategy and we know they\u2019re going to deliver many benefits to our customers. So, what we\u2019re really doing is we\u2019re looking at layers in the organization where we can flatten a little bit, increase our span of control so we can improve our decision making and also get a better coverage in our management layer. And while I would say the focus of this is truly strategic, it really is leading with our strategy. There will be some cost reductions associated with these changes later in the year.

We think it\u2019s still very early inning and we\u2019re absolutely in the sweet spot there with those capabilities and relative to where the book is going with therapeutic modalities. We were slightly soft on revenue in the first quarter. The focus there is really very heavily on bringing certain aspects of the operation up to the Agilent NASD standards with process and quality, and that\u2019s progressing really well. But then with regard to the full year guide, we\u2019re holding to the previous guidance and so no change there."

Actually, I would take that as a sign of the continued recovery, particularly in the instrumentation market. We did have an impact or a contribution from the Lunar New Year, but the real big area is both LC and LCMS. So, typically what we see is just because the way our fiscal year is that our first fiscal year because January is the last month of the quarter the instrument book-to-bill is typically lower than one. And so the fact that it\u2019s above one is a very positive sign from our perspective that recovery continues. And as we were saying, it\u2019s really been led by some of the new products in the unique attributes of our, the Infinity III portfolio and has given us or allowed us to have renewed conversations with customers and so forth."

I guess, what is the average age of the fleet? And when you do that math, what is incremental of that few hundred million versus a normal replacement cycle? And when you think about the attach rates on services and chemistry, do you feel like that part of the business is growing mid-to-high singles or where are we on services and consumables?"

But we\u2019re older than the median, I would say, of the age of the installed base. And the installed base is very large, very disparate, a lot of different equipment in it. So, we expect that we\u2019re going to see the pace of that change, continually improve throughout the year. And then there\u2019s a huge opportunity there in terms of opportunity for replacements. And also when that comes, of course, we have attach rate with the new Infinity III both on the services on the consumer side. So, I would say as well, just to mention that we did see an improvement at the end of year orders. If not back to pre-COVID days, but there was a sequential improvement in terms of December orders in terms of budget flush versus the previous year, which again was in large part about install base change. And I would say when I talk to lab managers out there and we talk to, high level procurement people there\u2019s a lot of pent up demand for, instrument changes. Lab managers are really pressing that. And we do see the purse strings loosening a bit within our pharma customers. But Angelica on service and consumables?"

To add to what you\u2019ve already said, it is going to the replacement cycle is going to occur over a period of time, and it\u2019s probably going to be a mix of some incremental, placements of new instruments as well as replacing some of the aging instruments on the lab bench. And what that really allows us to do is continue our focus on increasing our ability to connect services and consumables as those new instruments are being put into service, and we know that, that motion allows for greater and longer customer lifetime value both in how the customer is using that instrument but also in terms of the continued revenue stream that that generates for Agilent. So, there is upside and incremental opportunity, for sure. Understood."

Gross margin was a little lower just because of some of the mix of products. It wasn\u2019t anything material and I would expect that to improve throughout the course of the year. If you can imagine, with a large stimulus in China that did have some pressure on our margins at the gross margin level, but very profitable at the operating profit margin. And currency did have an impact as well in Q1, and that impact was roughly 20-30 basis points in the quarter for the total company. And I\u2019d expect some of that to continue throughout the course of the year. We do get some benefit because we do hedge, but still the drop through of that is greater on the gross margin. So, the one thing I would say, Brandon, to offset that is we were actually pleased with the pricing. Padraig mentioned about the pricing. It actually was trending a bit higher than what we had expected in Q1 and are expecting that to continue through the course of the year."

And the way the chemistry as well still is pretty a pretty small acorn, but the customer adoption there is looking pretty strong. So, as we look to the full year, I still think we see a path to return to growth in genomics.

And it was very broad based in terms of instruments that actually held most of our platforms in it. We won 50% of that stimulus order, which is around $35 million and was recognized essentially all of that was recognized in the quarter. That\u2019s a very extremely high, win rate. And of course, we think it\u2019s not all of that is incremental. We believe about half of it is kind of run rate pull forward. Half of that is incremental. And, but it shows when these stimulus come in, the Agilent team can really win its oversized share of it. And as I said before, you know, we\u2019re expecting more stimulus, which we haven\u2019t baked into the guide in the second half. But rest assured, when that arises, the Agilent team will be there to help customers."

Hey, Puneet, to build on what Padraig is saying, I actually see this as a really positive that we were able to not only get that revenue in, the orders in and actually deliver it, it\u2019s a real testament to the Agilent team. And so it actually gives me increased confidence that when the orders come in, we will get more than our fair share in the second half of the year. So, I think we still feel very optimistic about not just this year, but, you know, if you remember, this is a multi-year kind of stimulus program. And, so, we feel very good about the momentum that we have. I wouldn\u2019t look at it quarter-to-quarter. I look at it year-over-year."

You talked about pricing on one end, number of cost efforts and also reducing some of the management changes that you have in place. So just wondering how should we think about the margin contribution? Do you have a target, this year from Ignite? Thank you."

Actually, Ignite is a three year program. And what we said is over the three years, [72] (ph) basis points plus in terms of margin expansion. And of course, all of this doesn\u2019t happen all at once, right? So we\u2019ve seen early benefits both from the procurement, direct and indirect procurement side and from pricing in terms of what we\u2019re seeing. But of course, we\u2019ll see more in the second half and as we go into next year. But Bob, I don\u2019t know if you want to give more color on that."

We\u2019re going to have to work harder for that because of some of the currency.

When we caught up with you guys in January, it sounded like similar to the rest of the peer group, you had a strong December in terms of the instrument budget flush, especially in the pharma end market. And, I guess I\u2019m just wondering if one, I want to confirm that was the case that the end of the fiscal year came together strongly. And if so, it would be interesting to hear if there\u2019s anything, interesting that occurred in terms of a particular rebound in specific instrument categories, specific geographies, specific end markets, and then kind of building off of that. Was January normal? Or did you, you know, kind of go into the second topic I wanted to cover given the change in administration? If December felt a little more normal, did January feel maybe less normal given all the uncertainty in terms of pharma regs, academic funding, food and water testing. Any commentary on all of those things would be really helpful."

                            "text": "Okay. Thanks. So, I\u2019ll start off and I\u2019ll hand over to Bob. So, it was certainly as we talked before December, it did play out as we expect us. We did have that strong momentum. And what was driving that, overall demand, I would say particularly around Infinity III, but also we talked about PFAS testing and including, also what we\u2019re seeing in the GLP-I areas. And January new administration comes in a lot of changes. And of course, we\u2019re mitigating those changes as we go through it. The only area where we\u2019ve seen some softness is really in Academia, with NIH funding where things have really slowed down a bit. But of course, that\u2019s a very small part of our business and it\u2019s not within the guide on us. In pharma, when we talk to our customers, actually there\u2019s a lot of questions, you see a lot of discussions around Aira, etcetera, what changes might happen about international pricing index, etcetera. But I would say that hasn\u2019t impacted on the pharma side. We\u2019re still seeing a steady business coming out of that side, but everybody\u2019s really, really watching that. On the PFAS side, just going back to the pharma side as well, people were talking about FDA, changes within the FDA. I think that hit more of the medical device companies, areas within that expertise, but we haven\u2019t seen anything on us yet. And within PFAS, that business continues to be strong. We still see it in January, there\u2019s been no change in that as it happens. So, it\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to continue to watch very, very closely, hugely dynamic. But I would say January is a steady progression from December."

So, we\u2019re of course, we have heavy fleets and a lot of capabilities when QAQC and development for QAQC. So we saw that across the board on that side. I would say in R&D you see a lot of shifts in terms of where customers are spending money. So, we did actually see a good continuation of positivity on that side. But in the pharma QAQC and the development areas of labs, we\u2019ve seen continued, I would say, steadiness and incremental strength in it driven around a replacement of fleets and driven by the Infinity III. But Simon, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that."

And actually, so on the academic and government side, we\u2019ve had some impact there in cell analysis with our lower end instrumentation where although at company level, the exposure is very minimal within cell analysis, it\u2019s a little higher. But generally speaking, the funnels are robust in biopharma across the entire continuum. We\u2019re seeing really nice adoption of our NovoCyte Opteon platform, the spectral flow cytometer and the citation C10 is also performing really well. So a few puts and takes in cell analysis."

So, we have a very diverse manufacturing capability around and if you talk about the three areas for tariffs, we talked about in Mexico, we have no manufacturing. In Canada, we do have manufacturing with BIOVECTRA, but it\u2019s about 30%, I think is, put into the U.S. And of course, in China, we have in China, China on it. So we believe the overall impact is about $5 million and we actually believe that\u2019s very mitigated bodes down to much less than that and we\u2019re working on it. Just to give you a sense of it, we were able to shift our supply chain pretty quickly in areas from, say, China back into the U.S. and, into Singapore as well, which really is very mitigatable."

I just kind of want to make sure I understand the timing of it. If I\u2019m just going to go back to the slide deck, the negative seven in the quarter, you call out softness globally and then anticipated slowdown in government spending, impacts willingness to some customers are staying. So, is this things you started seeing back in November, December? I\u2019m just trying to think of the timing of what was happening in the quarter as it relates to election, inauguration, all of that. Any clarity there would be helpful."

So that\u2019s what we were talking about when we did see globally. We did see maybe a slight more in January incremental softness towards the end as people were trying to figure out the NAH activity. I wouldn\u2019t say that necessarily is super material for us. And as you know, the Academia and government can be kind of lumpy at times. So, the one area that I would say got disproportionate impact actually was China and a lot of that is some of the impact of the timing of the Lunar New Year. And so, I think that they were the most negative for the full Q1. And that we have a slightly larger exposure in Academia and government in China than we do relative to the rest of the world. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. Hopefully, that kind of clarifies, kind of what we were seeing."

And again in cell analysis the way I\u2019d characterize it is that we began to see hesitancy in Academia and government in the run up to the election last year. People were kind of in wait and see mode to see what happened with the election. Now what we\u2019re starting to see, of course, is that the impacts are real. And just to say, again, in cell analysis, we\u2019ve got proportionally higher exposure there in Academia and government than we do in many, if not all, other parts of our portfolio. So, your statement there about the relative impact is a true one and we don\u2019t see that elsewhere."

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the ultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work, because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process and the incredibly talented director John M. Chu recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we can't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an air tag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines, so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. and we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin.\nKevan Parekh: Thanks Tim, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high-end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strength across our lineup from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearable's home and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we face a difficult compare against the watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness Plus, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S., with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed 1,000 of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. In Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Kevin. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Certainly, we will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great guys, Thanks so much for taking my questions. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you had noted that iPhone 16 models are selling better in markets where Apple Intelligence is available? And I'm just wondering if you could double-click on that comment a bit and share any other details you believe could better help us understand how Apple Intelligence is really impacting iPhone demand and/or what features you find that users are using most often already? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, Eric. Hi, it's Tim. The -- we did see that the markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those where Apple Intelligence was not available. In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments from writing tools to image playground and Genmoji to visual intelligence and more. And so we see all of those being used. The cleanup is another one that is popular and people love seeing that one demoed in the stores as well. We only had 2, 2.5 weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of [18.2] (ph) and then only had the U.K. and the other English language countries for the 2.5 weeks. And so we've got just the early indications at the moment, but we were glad\u2026\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's really helpful.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nErik Woodring: Okay, thank you for that, Tim. It's helpful. And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently, if we set aside China Macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles. Just maybe double clicking on, on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yes, sure. If you look at our greater China revenue for the quarter, we were down 11% year-over-year. And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And of course on the Apple intelligence side we have not rolled out in China and as we just talked about we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smart watches up to a certain, a maximum price point. And so we do see fiscal stimulus occurring and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Tim. Good luck.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Eric. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for the question. And, hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you who -- you knew this one was coming, but there's a perception that you're a big beneficiary of lower cost of compute and I was wondering if you could give your worldly perspective here on the DeepSeek situation and if you are going to, if you, if anything's happened to change your views in terms of a tailwind to margins and your ability to execute even due to the potential for cost to come down due to that development and probably what was going to happen anyway. But I'd love your perspective on that and then have a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Sure. In general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing. And that's what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well. As you know, we do things on the device, and we do things in the private cloud and which mimics from a architectural point of view the -- what happens on the device. And from a CapEx point of view, we've always taken a very prudent and deliberate approach to our expenditure and we continue to leverage a hybrid model, which I think continues to serve us well.\nBen Reitzes: Oh, great. All right. Thanks, Tim. And then, you know, just with regard to, you know, the iPhone trajectory, do you feel like, I guess, what is -- you obviously don't talk about new products and stuff like that, but do you feel that there's a lot of room for form factor innovation in the future? Or do you feel that the current lineup kind of it shows where you're going? I guess without pulling punches wondering if you, you thought you know in terms of the phone innovation if there's a lot more to come and you could see the kind of current market changing a bit over the next two to three years. Thanks.\nTim Cook: I think, Ben, I think there's a lot more to come and I could not feel more optimistic about our product pipeline. So I think there's a lot of innovation left on the smartphone.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I have two as well. First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to? Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you for the question. If you look at iPhone, we did set an all-time record for upgraders, so we've never seen a higher level of upgraders before. The installed base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15. And so I think you can conclude from that, that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not. So lots\u2026\nMichael Ng: Great, thank you, Tim. That's\u2026\nTim Cook: Yes, lots of good color there.\nMichael Ng: Great, thank you, Tim. That's very clear. And then I had one about the iPad Pro and for the thinner version. I was just wondering if you could talk about that thin form factor for the iPad Pro. How did it help iPad sales overall and what did your kind of marketing consumer research tell you about how consumers valued that thin product form factor? Thank you.\nTim Cook: It's a good question. iPad overall grew 15% for the quarter and it was more driven by iPad Air and the entry level iPad than it was the top level iPad. But overall we could not be more pleased with the iPad category growing 15%. It's a great achievement for the quarter. And probably what is most important is that over half of the sales in the December quarter went to customers who were new to the iPad. So that tells us that there's a good amount of customers there to attract.\nMichael Ng: Thank you very much, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Mike. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. Maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some very robust growth trends in emerging markets right now for Apple products? Can you just add a high level, just talk about the durability of growth that you see in emerging markets? And then do you think the summation of these emerging markets are starting to get big enough or perhaps starting to grow fast enough that it can actually offset some of the China headwinds you're going through?\nTim Cook: We have great results in a number of emerging markets. And as you know from past calls, I'm particularly keen on India. India set a December quarter record during the quarter. And we're opening more stores there. We've announced that we're going to open four new stores there. We also, the iPhone was the top selling model in India for the quarter. And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets and so there's a huge market and we are -- we have very modest share in these markets. And so I think there's lots of upside there. And that's just one of the emerging markets.\nKevan Parekh: Yes, maybe I'll add, Amit, that in emerging markets we're also seeing double-digit growth on the install base, both in total and for the iPhone as well. So that's also an encouraging sign.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you. And then, you know, just a question on gross margins for the March quarter. You folks are guiding gross margin is flattish on a sequential basis. Typically, I think it tends to be guided up a little bit, 50 basis points, so sequentially. Can we just touch on like, what are the offsets of the puts and takes you see here on gross margins? And Kevan, maybe you can just talked about its FX having an outsized impact in your margin profile as well in March?\nKevan Parekh: Yes, Amit, let me take that One. You know, as we mentioned in my remarks, we're guiding to 46.5% to 47.5%. So we think it's, you know, we're very pleased with that level of guidance. As you mentioned, there's always puts and takes. We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well. You know, it'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. But we think that's going to be offset by favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also, as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have a loss of leverage. So there are some puts and takes, and I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, I want to follow-up on your comment about channel inventory in China. I was wondering if you could maybe address more broadly if channel inventory across your different product lines and regions? Do you feel they're elevated or out of range in any other regions? And given the clearing event that kind of happened in China, I guess in the quarter, should we think of a more normal progression quarter-on-quarter into the March quarter in China in particular, and I will follow.\nTim Cook: Yes, I don't want to project sales for the current quarter by region, but if you if you look at the channel inventory and look at iPhone in the aggregate, so on a worldwide basis we're very comfortable with our channel inventory position in the -- in China my point was that our channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, and that was over half of the reduction in the reported results. And so if you look, part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thank you.\nWamsi Mohan: And then maybe as my follow-up, your services growth has been very strong and I know you've kind of been navigating some pretty challenging regulatory burdens on the business globally. So how should investors think about maybe either a top line or margin headwind that let's say you're currently absorbing in your results that could potentially maybe reverse in a more balanced regulatory environment? Thank you so much.\nKevan Parekh: Yes. So I think one, I just wanted to kind of reiterate the fact that, you know, our services business had an all-time record for December quarter of 14%. And that was a one strength that we saw across all geographic segments and also was very broad base across all of our services. So we have, as you know, a very broad services portfolio. And so we do see, you know, good momentum across the board. And as well, we continue to see increasing engagement across the customer base, across all of the service offerings, both transacting and paid accounts. We talked about reaching all-time highs, and we have over now 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services platform.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, if I -- I mean, you had a great quarter on Macs and iPads both. And I'm just curious, in terms of if you can help us think about the sustainability of this double-digit growth that you saw in both the product lines, and more interest are also here, we are talking about Apple Intelligence sort of influencing volumes on iPhones, but any thoughts on sort of how -- what does that influence look like in terms of volumes for Macs, for example, where I think there's a lot of conversation on AI PCs, how you're thinking about the impact there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at Mac, Mac was up 16% and on iPad, we were up 15%. The Mac was driven by the very strong uptake on our new products during the quarter and the continued success of the MacBook Air. And so as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And Tim, I'm going to use your earlier discussion about India as a strong emerging market to sort of ask you about the supply chain planning there in terms of how much of the supply chain planning there that you're doing is more of a reflection of the growth expectations from that market relative to in terms of diversification of the supply chain? And how should we sort of think about that strategy in terms of that particular country? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at the manufacturing we do there, we do manufacturing both for the domestic market, and we export. And so in -- our business needs a certain economies of scale for it to make sense to manufacture in country. And so that really means that we're going to be both a use for the domestic market and an export market.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks, guys, for taking my question. So maybe, Tim, this is for you. I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business. But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of, feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year? So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter. But just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was, that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so that gives us -- it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say, that I think I mentioned earlier, is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. And so I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter. And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question.\nDavid Vogt: Yes, great.\nKevan Parekh: Hi, David. How are you? So on the Services gross margin, I think maybe just stepping back a second. Services business in general in aggregate is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things, as an important reminder, is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles. And so I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so one of the big factors that drive the Services gross margins and relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud, that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to margins as well. And so in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint of 46.5% to 47.5%, which again, we think is a strong guide.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks, guys.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right, thank you, David. Operator, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I also had two of them. One, the first one for Tim. You had very strong Mac growth, 16% year-over-year last quarter. Just wondering how much of that was driven by some of the Mac silicon innovation versus a replacement cycle for Macs?\nTim Cook: I don't know the answer to your question precisely, but I think it is a combination of these products are so compelling, the M4-based products are so compelling, that it's driving both upgrades at the double-digit level and it's driving switchers at a double-digit level. And so we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks for that, Tim. And then a follow-up for Kevan on the gross margin. I want to ask you on the product side. Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year ago period. I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?\nKevan Parekh: Yes. Thanks, Krish, for the question. So on the product side, as you mentioned, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points, for the December quarter. That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the various product launches that we have. Different products do have different margin profiles. And so that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. So we're continuing to see that trend, that impacted us in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but we figured that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave, the 46.5% to 47.5%.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, Kevan. Thanks, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first question is for Tim. I'd like to ask about what might accelerate the pace of Apple Intelligence adoption. I guess do you see this simply as a question of time i.e., to launch more markets and languages or increase the percentage of installed base devices that can support it? Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI? And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream? Thanks.\nTim Cook: I do believe it will go mainstream. I'm getting feedback from people using different features today. And this is -- keep in mind that on the iPhone side of our business, you either have to have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 to use Apple Intelligence. And so the -- as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow. And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get 100s of e-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So I think it's a combination of that. And of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thank you. And then, Kevan, one of Luca's legacies was really getting Apple to record margin levels and also maintaining very consistent pricing across the product range. But taking the current high levels of profitability as fairly stable, what observations might you share about price sensitivity of users and whether having a wider range of pricing across the products might unlocks potentially further market share gains or boost overall product growth?\nKevan Parekh: Yes, it's a good question. I think one, I don't think we're going to really depart from what served us pretty well to now. I mean we always take it into consideration, looking at short-term -- comparison between the short term and the long term. I think we've had a pretty disciplined pricing strategy, which would serve us pretty well. And I think we're going to continually kind of stick with that as far as I can tell.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, could we get the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. How do you guys see the potential tariff impact to your product for consumer demand under Trump 2.0 you guys did find under Trump 1.0?\nTim Cook: We are monitoring the situation and don't have anything more to add than that.\nAtif Malik: Great. And Tim, as a follow-up, there is a lot of discussion on agentic AI, the use of agents. Do you guys see the upgraded series expected in April as something that will, let's say, be the killer application among the suite of features that you have announced in Apple Intelligence?\nTim Cook: I think the killer feature is different for different people. But I think for most, they're going to find that they're going to use many of the features every day. And certainly, one of those is the -- is Siri, and that will be coming over the next several months.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Atif. Operator, could we please get the last question?\nOperator: Our last question is from Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.\nBen Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I'm interested in your thoughts and how you would have us think about the average useful life of these devices in the wild. And in particular, curious, if you look at the strength you saw in fiscal \u201821 and how that might support accelerated refresh opportunity into the future?\nTim Cook: Yes. Ben, I think it's different for different types of users. I mean you have very early adopter kind of users that are very quick to jump on the latest technology that upgrade very frequently. And then you have people that are on the entire opposite side of that barbell. And most people are between those two points. And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the COVID period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company to -- for more than one of the product categories.\nBen Bollin: That\u2019s it from me. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Ben.

Before I talk about our results I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area this month. From our retail teams to Apple TV+, Apple Music, Fitness Plus, Beats and more LA is home to many of our team members. Our thoughts are with everyone who is beginning the road to recovery. For our part, we are contributing to the relief efforts and we will continue to support our teams and the local community. Now turning to the quarter. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, up 4% from a year ago, and an all-time record. EPS also set an all-time record of $2.40, 10% higher year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records across the majority of the countries and regions we track, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia Pacific. We also continue to see momentum in emerging markets, setting all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, among others. In services, we achieved an all-time revenue record, and in the past year, we've seen nearly $100 billion in revenue from our services business. I'm also pleased to announce that we reached a new record for our installed base with over 2.35 billion active devices. In October, we released the first set of Apple Intelligence features in U.S. English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and we rolled out more features and expanded to more countries in December. Now users can discover the benefits of these new features in the things they do every day. They can use writing tools to help find just the right words, create fun and unique images with Image Playground and Genmoji, handle daily tasks and seek out information with a more natural and conversational Siri, create movies of their memories with a simple prompt, and touch up their photos with clean up. We introduced visual intelligence with camera control to help users instantly learn about their surroundings. Users can also seamlessly access chat GPT across iOS, iPadOS and MacOS. And we were excited to recently begin our international expansion with Apple Intelligence now available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. We're working hard to take Apple Intelligence even further. In April, we're bringing Apple Intelligence to more languages, including French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese, as well as localized English to Singapore and India. And we'll continue to roll out more features in the future, including an even more capable Siri. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovations we've made across hardware and software to transform how users experience our products. Apple Intelligence also empowers users by delivering personal context that's relevant to them. And importantly, Apple Intelligence is a breakthrough for privacy and AI with innovations like Private Cloud Compute, which extends the industry-leading security and privacy of Apple devices into the cloud. Apple Intelligence opens up an exciting new frontier and is already elevating experiences across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. We're going to keep investing in innovation and in transformative tools that help users in their everyday lives. Let me now turn to our results for the quarter, starting with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $69.1 billion, reaching all-time iPhone revenue records in dozens of markets and regions. Our iPhone 16 lineup takes the smartphone experience to the next level in so many ways, and Apple Intelligence is one of many reasons why customers are excited. With the A18 powered iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, users are getting a big boost in battery life and incredible camera experiences with camera control. Our amazingly powerful iPhone 16 Pro models go even further with larger-than-ever displays and a pro camera system so advanced it can turn moments into masterpieces. In Mac, revenue was $9 billion for the December quarter, 16% higher year-over-year, driven by significant excitement around the world for our latest Mac lineup. The Mac is more than just a powerful tool. It's a launchpad to enable users to bring their best ideas and boldest creations to life. And there are so many reasons to choose Mac, from the breathtaking performance of the M4 family of chips to the groundbreaking and growing capabilities of Apple Intelligence. Every product in the Mac lineup offers something extraordinary, whether that's the super portable MacBook Air, the powerhouse MacBook Pro, the world's best all-in-one iMac, or the small wonder that is the Mac Mini, which is not only stunningly capable, but is our first carbon neutral Mac. All of this is enabled by the unparalleled power of Apple Silicon. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago, driven by strong interest for our latest products. We love hearing from customers, who are discovering for the first time the versatility of iPad from the ultra-portal iPad Mini, built from the ground up for Apple intelligence, to the powerful M4 iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design. iPad is there for our users whenever they need it and wherever they go and we are pleased to see so much excitement and enthusiasm for our lineup. Wearables home and accessories revenue came in at $11.7 billion. With its most advanced display yet and a thinner more comfortable design, the all-new Apple Watch Series 10 is the perfect companion to help users pursue their health and fitness goals this year. From the powerful Vitals app to more customizable activity rings, users have an ever-increasing set of innovative health tools at their fingertips and watchOS 11. Health innovation has long been a focus for us, and we're committed to continuing to advance this work, because we know how much it matters to our users. We've introduced new hearing health features on AirPods Pro 2, and new sleep apnea notifications on Apple Watch are also helping users learn of a potentially serious condition that's thought to affect up to a billion people worldwide. During the quarter, we also brought Apple Vision Pro to even more countries, enabling more customers to discover the magic of spatial computing. Users are enjoying incredible immersive entertainment experiences and powerful new features and enhancements to Mac virtual display. Vision Pro is also supercharging the creative process and the incredibly talented director John M. Chu recently shared how its extraordinary capabilities helped him bring the movie Wicked to life. Turning to services, we set an all-time revenue record of $26.3 billion for the December quarter, growing 14% from a year ago. We set all-time records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific, and a December quarter record in Japan. Five years since launch, Apple TV+ continues to be home to incredible storytelling that viewers love. There's nothing quite like the anticipation that comes when a fan favorite returns, and we were thrilled to debut the second season of Severance earlier this month. We have so much in store for our subscribers this year with new shows like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. And we can't wait for the premiere of Formula 1 starring Brad Pitt on June 27, which will take viewers inside the sport in a truly unprecedented way. We're excited that Apple TV+ continues to draw attention and accolades. To-date, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,500 nominations and 538 wins. During the quarter, we were also excited to launch a new Find My Service that can help our users when they lose their luggage. For the first time, if you put an air tag in your suitcase, you'll be able to share its location information with many major airlines, so they can quickly track down your bags if they get lost. Turning to retail, our teams went above and beyond to help customers find the perfect gift throughout the holiday season. We also celebrated openings of new stores in China, Spain, and the U.S. and we were excited to announce plans to connect with even more customers this year by adding a fifth store in the UAE and bringing our online store to Saudi Arabia this summer. We can't wait to welcome customers to the first of several flagship store locations in Saudi Arabia that were opening beginning in 2026. I just had the chance to visit both countries last month, and I had a great time meeting with customers and team members. There's an incredible energy and passion for technology in these growing markets. Every day, I get deeply moving notes about the many ways our technology is enriching our users' lives. I recently got a note from a customer who put his watch on his father's wrist when he feared something was wrong with him. The watch alerted them that the father was an AFib and they were able to get him to the hospital for potentially life-saving treatment. Another user put his new watch on for the first time and within 15 minutes was notified of a low heart rate that led to a necessary pacemaker. And there are so many touching notes around the profound impact of our new hearing health feature like a recent user who told me it had changed her life, allowing her to take part in conversations with her children and grandchildren. These are the kind of stories that remind us of how profoundly important our work is, and it drives us to innovate each and every day. At Apple, the future is full of promise and potential. We're always searching across a world of possibilities, finding those places where we can do the most good and putting all of our energy and ingenuity into making something special. With that, I'll turn it over to Kevin."

                            "text": "Thanks Tim, and good afternoon everyone. I'm going to cover the results for the first quarter of our fiscal year. We are very pleased to report an all-time high for revenue with December quarter revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. We achieved all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Japan, and rest of Asia Pacific and grew in the vast majority of markets we track. Products revenue was $98 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by growth from iPad and Mac. Thanks to our incredible customer satisfaction and strong loyalty, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments and is now over 2.35 billion active devices. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We grew in every geographic segment and achieved all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.9% at the high-end of our guidance range and up 70 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 39.3%, up 300 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 75%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix. Operating expenses of $15.4 billion landed at the midpoint of our guidance range and up 7% year-over-year. This strong business performance resulted in all-time records for both net income at $36.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.40, up 10% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was also strong at $29.9 billion, which included the impact of the $11.9 billion we paid during the quarter in connection with the state aid decision. Now, I'm going to provide some more details for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.1 billion, roughly flat to the prior year. We grew in the majority of markets we track and reached all-time revenue records in several developed markets, including Canada, Western Europe, and Japan and in emerging markets like Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The iPhone Active installed base grew to an all-time high in total in an average geographic segment. We also set an all-time record for upgraders. According to a recent survey from Kantar during the December quarter, iPhone was a top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, India, the U.K., France, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction in the U.S. at 96% as measured by 451 research. Mac generated $9 billion in revenue, up 16% year-over-year. We saw strength across our lineup from the new Mac Mini to the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. This incredible performance was broad-based with double-digit growth in every geographic segment. With our latest advances in Apple Silicon and our fastest neural engine ever, customers are able to take advantage of the full capabilities of AI and Mac. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high and we saw a double-digit growth for both upgraders and customers new to the Mac. Additionally, customer satisfaction in the U.S. was recently measured at 94%. iPad revenue was $8.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, driven by the new iPad Mini and latest iPad Air. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Customer satisfaction was at 96% in the U.S. based on the latest reports from 451 Research. Wearable's home and accessories revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Customers are excited about the new AirPods 4 and the latest hearing health features in AirPods Pro 2. On watch, although we face a difficult compare against the watch Ultra 2 launch last year, the Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Customer satisfaction for watch in the U.S. was reported at 94%. Our services revenue reached an all-time high of $26.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Services continues to see strong momentum, and the growth of our installed base of active devices gives us great opportunities for the future. We also see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting and paid accounts reached new all-time highs, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. We remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services offerings, from new games on Apple Arcade to exciting new programming on Fitness Plus, and the continued expansion of features like Tap to Pay, now live in 20 markets. Turning to enterprise, we have seen businesses continue to expand their deployments of our products and services. Deutsche Bank launched its Mac as Choice program for the developers and also issued the latest MacBook Air as a standard computer for their entire mortgage lending division. And we're excited to see leading enterprises such as SAP leverage Apple Intelligence in the U.S., with features like writing tools, summarize, and priority notifications to enhance both their employee and customer experiences. We also see strong demand in our emerging markets. For example, Zomato, a leading food ordering and delivery company in India, has deployed 1,000 of Macs across their workforce to foster innovation. In Vision Pro continues to see more use cases in enterprise, with Cisco's new spatial meetings delivering a fully immersive video conferencing experience for remote collaboration and learning. Let me quickly summarize our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $141 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8 billion, resulting in $97 billion in total debt. Therefore, net cash at the end of the quarter was $45 billion. During the quarter, we returned over $30 billion to shareholders. This included $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.3 billion through open market repurchases of 100 million Apple shares. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. As the dollar is strengthened significantly, we expect foreign exchange to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 2.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. Despite that headwind, we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid-single-digits year-over-year. We expect services revenue to grow low-double-digits year-over-year. When you remove the negative impact of the foreign exchange headwinds I described earlier, the year-over-year growth rate would be comparable to that of the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46.5% and 47.5%. We expect operating expenses to be between $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on February 13, 2025, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2025. With that, let's open to call the questions."

In terms of the features that people are using, they're using all of the ones that I'd referenced in my opening comments from writing tools to image playground and Genmoji to visual intelligence and more. And so we see all of those being used. The cleanup is another one that is popular and people love seeing that one demoed in the stores as well. We only had 2, 2.5 weeks or so during the December quarter of the second release of [18.2] (ph) and then only had the U.K. and the other English language countries for the 2.5 weeks. And so we've got just the early indications at the moment, but we were glad\u2026"

And then, you know, if we just touch on China, obviously, in the news fairly frequently, if we set aside China Macro, which I understand is still challenging, can you maybe talk about the headwinds that that Apple faces, whether that's, you know, shifting preferences for Western technology brands in favor of domestic vendors, or is this just a function of not necessarily having Apple intelligence available with the iPhone 16, which is, you know, not necessarily helping replacement cycles. Just maybe double clicking on, on what you think and what you're hearing in China as a regard as it relates to the iPhone. Thanks so much."

And over half of the decline that we experienced was driven by change in channel inventory from the beginning to the end of the quarter. And of course on the Apple intelligence side we have not rolled out in China and as we just talked about we did see better results in the markets that we had rolled out in than markets we hadn't rolled out in. And of course, it's the most competitive market in the world. And so all of those things are true. In terms of the macro situation, there was a fiscal stimulus or subsidy announced in very recently in January that did not affect the December quarter. There were some provincial subsidies in the December quarter, but the national program was announced, I believe, on January 20. And it does cover the categories that we have products in from smartphones to tablets and PCs and smart watches up to a certain, a maximum price point. And so we do see fiscal stimulus occurring and we'll be glad to talk about what that looks like on the next call."

Or do you feel that the current lineup kind of it shows where you're going?

First, it was encouraging to hear about the record for iPhone upgraders, which I think is something you haven't said for about a year now. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you would attribute this upgrade strength to? Has Apple Intelligence played a role in helping upgrades in the markets that you've launched in? Thanks."

The installed base hit a new all-time high as well. And if you look at the 16, compared to the 15 from launch, which occurred, as you know, in September, so this is across now two quarters from September to the end of the December fiscal quarter, the 16 outperformed the 15. And so I think you can conclude from that, that there are compelling reasons to upgrade. And in the markets where we had launched Apple Intelligence, they outperformed the markets that we did not.

We also, the iPhone was the top selling model in India for the quarter. And it's the second largest smartphone market in the world and the third largest for PCs and tablets and so there's a huge market and we are -- we have very modest share in these markets.

We do think there's going to be some FX headwinds, which we talked about, that's going to affect, you know, our revenue growth as well. You know, it'll have an impact here on the margin, a sequential impact on margins. But we think that's going to be offset by favorable costs and the relative mix of services. We also, as you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, especially on the product side, because Q1 is such a large quarter for a products business, we do have a loss of leverage. So there are some puts and takes, and I think we feel good about the range. We think it's a very, very strong guide for gross margin."

And so if you look, part of the reason for that is that our sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter.

And so as you know, we've launched an M4-based MacBook Pro, an iMac and a Mac Mini during the quarter. We believe we've got the best AI PC out there for running workloads. The silicon in the Mac is, and it has been for several years now, designed by us and really designed for these workloads. And so I don't want to project at the category level for the future, but we're incredibly pleased with both the Mac and the iPad for the quarter."

I'm trying to think about your commentary around Apple Intelligence being sort of a momentum driver for the iPhone business. But when I think about your kind of framework for the March quarter, if I kind of adjust for channel inventory over the last couple of years, kind of, feels like your iPhone revenue for the March quarter is going to be relatively similar to the quarter two years ago and even the quarter last year? So how do we square kind of the momentum versus kind of the iPhone business effectively really kind of unchanged over the last couple of years? And then second, when I think about kind of the gross margin profile of the business, obviously, you've done a great job in taking gross margins up. Where do you think we sit in terms of, on the services side at least, where margins could go? It looks like the 75% margin has been incredibly successful quarter. But just trying to get a sense for where do you think this number could go over the intermediate term? Thank you."

If you look at Apple Intelligence, what my point earlier was, that markets where we had rolled out Apple Intelligence during the Q1 period performed better on a year-over-year basis than markets where we had not. And so that gives us -- it's a positive indicator that we were pleased with. There are many compelling reasons to upgrade. And the other thing I would say, that I think I mentioned earlier, is that if you look at it from a launch to the end of the December quarter, and so that goes back to September, the 16 family is outperforming the 15 family. And so I think those are two good data points. Our next round of language rollouts will be in April. And so it will be at the -- in our Q3 quarter. And I'll let Kevan take the gross margin question."

                            "text": "Hi, David. How are you? So on the Services gross margin, I think maybe just stepping back a second. Services business in general in aggregate is accretive to the overall company margin. And one of the things, as an important reminder, is we've got a very broad services portfolio. And those businesses have very different margin profiles. And so I think, one, it's because of the nature of those businesses and in part also because of the way we account for them. And so one of the big factors that drive the Services gross margins and relative performance of those different businesses within the portfolio. We also have the dynamic of some scale businesses like payment services, iCloud, that are actually growing. And there, when we add incremental users, those end up being accretive to margins as well. And so in general, what we saw in the December quarter was nice momentum across our entire services business that allows us to deliver that 75% margin at the services level. And I think our guidance takes into consideration what we think we're going to land from a company standpoint of 46.5% to 47.5%, which again, we think is a strong guide."

And so we're seeing both come out, and I think it's just because of the compelling products."

Last quarter, you had 39.3%, which is very strong, similar to a year ago period. I'm kind of curious how much more levels do you have on the product side to improve the gross margin? Or do you think with some of the more new AI-related devices, there's more upside to gross margin from here on the product hardware side?"

                            "text": "Yes. Thanks, Krish, for the question. So on the product side, as you mentioned, we had pretty strong sequential improvement, 300 basis points, for the December quarter. That was really driven by, we talked about, favorable mix and leverage. As you know, in Q1, again, it's a launch quarter for many products, and so we tend to benefit from the leverage that we get from that higher volume. I would say, in general, our gross margin on products is driven by a number of factors. One of them is the various product launches that we have. Different products do have different margin profiles. And so that mix does make a difference. And in particular, what we're seeing is, for example, many of our mix is across like phone, for example, we're seeing customers gravitate towards our Pro products because of things like affordability that allows our customers to get into our best products, which have favorable gross margins. So we're continuing to see that trend, that impacted us in the December quarter. As well, I think we're in a favorable commodity environment from a cost standpoint. And so we're benefiting from that as well in the December quarter. And then that's going to be, as we talked about, we're going to have a foreign exchange headwind heading into the March quarter, but we figured that's contemplated in the guidance range that we gave, the 46.5% to 47.5%."

Or is it a question of money, i.e., shifting R&D or marketing spend towards AI? And based on other prior Apple services, do you expect a sort of tipping point where adoption will go mainstream?

And so the -- as that base grows, I think the usage will continue to grow. And I think -- I know from my own personal experience, once you start using the features, you can't imagine not using them anymore. I know I get 100s of e-mails a day, and the summarization function is so important. So I think it's a combination of that. And of course, in April, we roll out a whole series of new languages that we had mentioned, and so the base grows further."
